# DQN-DRQN-Comparison
This was the project for my COS703 Data Handling class. It compared Deep Q-Learning Networks against Deep Recurrent Q-Learning networks in a fully and partially observable environment.

More information on this project can be found on [my webpage](http://dl-thompson.com/2017-05-08-COS703-Final-Project/).
